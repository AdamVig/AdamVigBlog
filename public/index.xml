      <title>Skill, Not Talent</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Talent is natural aptitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skill is hard-earned knowledge and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling a person talented implies that they were born with the
abilities they currently have. Talent is raw, untrained ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling a person skilled shows respect for the hard work it took to
develop their abilities. Skill is honed, well-practiced ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a much greater compliment to call someone &lt;em&gt;skilled&lt;/em&gt; than to
call them &amp;ldquo;talented&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It Starts With The In-Ear Mix</title>
      <link>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/inearmix/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The key to a good musical performance is confidence. Confidence comes from
comfort. Comfort means the musician can clearly hear himself or herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The in-ear mix is the key to a musician&amp;rsquo;s performance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-ear mix has a few parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-the-headphones:ed4f67177b1f00bf56b6075a6581d796&#34;&gt;1) The Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones/se-earphones/se215-sound-isolating-earphones&#34;&gt;Shure SE215 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;.
$100 is a small amount to spend on a crucial part of
your performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two considerations when buying earbuds: build quality and sound
quality. All Shure earbuds are built to last. The SE215s and above have
removable cables, meaning that you can fix your headphones for the price of a
new cable (around $30) instead of having to buy a whole new pair. The SE215s
have a warm, full, reliable sound. You will not miss anything when you wear
these onstage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foam tips provide a tight, bass-enhancing seal that blocks
out ambient noise to protect your hearing. Always wear both earbuds. If you leave
one earbud out, you will damage your hearing. One ear is hearing the loud house
mix and the other is hearing the relatively quiet in-ear mix, so you will
naturally turn up the in-ear mix to compensate. You might not suffer hearing loss
in the open ear, but you will suffer hearing loss in the ear with the loud
in-ear mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read my guide on wearing the Shure SE215s &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b4MDASpO0i5x4Lvz0Hg9bVW1p-gWygIKmWBJi3Tqkyc/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-the-mix:ed4f67177b1f00bf56b6075a6581d796&#34;&gt;2) The Mix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not turn every channel up. Turn the click track or rhythm-keeping instrument
up, then the lead vocalist, then your own instrument and/or vocal. Everything
else is fluff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of panning. Pan the vocals, drums, or anything else to the
hard left and right to clear out some space in your in-ear mix. This may sound
abstract, but panning is the key to bringing your in-ear mix to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the ambient microphone. The ambient microphone is intended
to give the musician an idea of what the house mix sounds like and what the
audience is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Snapchat Marketing is Easy!</title>
      <link>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/snapchatmarketing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to social media marketing, Snapchat has a limited feature set but
an undeniably huge reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-geofilters:dfd6787b40bdf4da52f92e7bca3bfb67&#34;&gt;Use Geofilters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snapchat Geofilters are graphics that users can overlay on Snapchat photos and
videos when they are in certain locations. Geofilters are a great way to
create a brand for a specific location such as a city, a neighborhood, or a
university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snapchat&amp;rsquo;s terms and conditions do not allow the use of logos or trademarks in
Geofilters. Still, your Geofilter can use colors and text to give your brand a
fun personality and to associate it with a specific geographical area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to submit your own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.snapchat.com/geofilters/&#34;&gt;Snapchat Geofilters page&lt;/a&gt;
and click the button to get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design your Geofilter using the guidelines on this page. Optionally, download
and use a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://highedwebtech.com/2015/06/25/snapchat-geofilter-template/&#34;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt;.
Save your Geofilter as &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the button to go to the Geofilter submission page on the Snapchat
website. Upload your image. Draw an area on the map in which this Geofilter
should be accessible. Fill out your name, email, and why this location is
meaningful to you. If this Geofilter is for an event, fill out a start and end
time for the event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit the form and wait for Snapchat to approve your request (it will take
a few days).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-an-account:dfd6787b40bdf4da52f92e7bca3bfb67&#34;&gt;Create an Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Snapchat account for your organization if you want to connect with
people in an organic and personal way. Snapchat accounts are not for posting
advertisements. They are for posting raw behind-the-scenes content that would
not &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; on other social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great idea for an organization is to purchase a dedicated Snapchat device.
Since Snapchat does not allow an account to be signed in to multiple devices at
once, you will have to log out of your personal account and log in to your
organization&amp;rsquo;s account every time you want to use it. Buy an iPod Touch or iPad
to solve this problem and to allow more people to participate in posting
content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up with your organization&amp;rsquo;s email address and, if possible, phone
number.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One option is to create a Google Voice account with a new phone number
so that the Snapchat account is not tied to a personal cell phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the username to something short and memorable - other people will have
to type it to follow the account on their phones and you will have to type it
every time you log in to the account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure your settings correctly.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the camera screen, tap the ghost icon in the top center then tap the gear
icon on the overlay that appears. This will bring you to your account
settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt;: Your name is what will show up next to your story. This can have
spaces, capital letters, emoji, and special characters. Use it to
differentiate your organization and make your story stand out. If you do not
set a name, it will default to your boring, lowercase username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile Number&lt;/strong&gt;: If your account is tied to a personal cell phone number,
disable &lt;em&gt;Allow My Friends to Find Me&lt;/em&gt; to avoid associating your organization
with a specific person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Additional Services&lt;/strong&gt;: Enable Filters here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Can Send Me Snaps&lt;/strong&gt;: Leave this set to &lt;em&gt;My Friends&lt;/em&gt; to avoid unwanted
Snaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Can View My Story&lt;/strong&gt;: Set this to &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt;. This will enable people
to watch your story immediately after they add you without having to wait
for you to add them back. In fact, you should not add people back on Snapchat.
It can make your organization seem &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; personal and allows potentially
unwanted Snaps from your followers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get snapping!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;share-your-snapcode:dfd6787b40bdf4da52f92e7bca3bfb67&#34;&gt;Share Your Snapcode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Snapcode is a specialized QR code that allows people to add you on Snapchat by
simply pointing their camera at it or loading an image of it into Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could take a screenshot of it in the app, but the best place to get a clean
copy of your Snapcode is the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/snapcodes&#34;&gt;Snapcode download page&lt;/a&gt;. You
will get a &lt;code&gt;.zip&lt;/code&gt; file containing your Snapcode in both &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; (vector) and
&lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; formats as well as a &lt;code&gt;.pdf&lt;/code&gt; of guidelines for using the Snapcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post this image on social networks and print it on posters or handouts so
people can add your account. Always include the username of the account
with the Snapcode in case the code does not scan properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-awesome-content:dfd6787b40bdf4da52f92e7bca3bfb67&#34;&gt;Create Awesome Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post something on your story every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Videos are more interesting than photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut to the chase: your followers will skip any part of your story that does
not immediately grab their attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only post content that would not &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; on another social network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a few general pointers, but there is no formula for creating great
Snapchat content. Be honest, personal, and interesting in your Snapchat stories
to get people talking about your Snapchat account and, better yet, your brand as
a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cross-Posting is Lazy Social Media Strategy</title>
      <link>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/lazycrossposting/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/lazycrossposting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cross-posting (n): automatically posting content from one social network to
one or more other social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-posting is lazy social media strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media users demand content tailored to the audience. Even though the
audience consists of most of the same people between social networks, those
people expect different types of content on each social network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- low-frequency posts&lt;br /&gt;
- long-form text content is common in the post description&lt;br /&gt;
- focus on the media, not the network&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- multimedia posts&lt;br /&gt;
- enough text content to explain the media in the post&lt;br /&gt;
- emphasis on engagement in comments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- high-frequency posts&lt;br /&gt;
- brief text content&lt;br /&gt;
- multimedia posts get the same screen space as text-only posts&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Cell Phone Upgrade Strategy</title>
      <link>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/cellphoneupgrade/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/cellphoneupgrade/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.adamvig.com/img/post/peoplewhobuythings.gif&#34; alt=&#34;People Who Buy Things Are Suckers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never buy a cell phone new at full price.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cell carriers are no longer offering subsidies on new phones. $700 is too much
to spend for that new iPhone. The solution: buy used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying used phones gives you the freedom to buy and sell phones whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your first phone is your upfront investment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put a protective case and screen protector on the phone the moment you take it
out of the box to protect this investment. Protect your investment so you can
sell it for top dollar down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you buy a new phone, sell your current phone to recoup some or all of the
cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the market price of your current phone before you purchase a new phone to
set a price range for your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to buy and sell phones:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All three of these sites have buyer protection, so if your phone is defective
you can send it back for a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://glyde.com&#34;&gt;Glyde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  - Easiest for selling: they ship you a box to put the phone in&lt;br /&gt;
  - Highest fees for selling&lt;br /&gt;
  - Useful indicator of market price&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://swappa.com&#34;&gt;Swappa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  - Low selling fees&lt;br /&gt;
  - Buyer talks directly to seller, not through Swappa&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ebay.com&#34;&gt;Ebay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  - Highest level of risk, but often the best offers&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Iterating</title>
      <link>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/oniterating/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/oniterating/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To iterate is to repeat with the intent of reaching a desired goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you know what you want to achieve but you have to create several drafts
along the way, you are iterating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iterating can be a process of proving yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In situations where money is involved, and the big picture requires a large
purchase, the big picture can be attained through a process of several small
purchases that prove the validity of the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In situations where the goal is a dramatic change in the way something is done,
the change can be achieved through a process of proving that the change will be
better. Apply the process in small pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iterating can help you see that your ideas are misguided. Instead of going all
in with an unproven idea, the process of iteration forces you to pick your own
idea apart. If it is a good idea, this process has the byproduct of making your
idea succeed. If it is not a good idea, you will see it and change the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To iterate is to prove yourself a little bit at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pull, Not Push</title>
      <link>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/pushvspull/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.adamvig.com/post/pushvspull/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlock your phone, open all of your social apps, and turn off push
notifications. Only enable push notifications for apps that need instant
responses, such as messages and email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you allow apps to send you push notifications, you give them control over
your schedule. Your attention span is defined by the period in between
interruptions from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works better than putting your phone on silent because important
notifications will still come through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reclaim your attention span. &lt;strong&gt;Pull&lt;/strong&gt; information on your own terms instead of
letting apps &lt;strong&gt;push&lt;/strong&gt; the information to you.&lt;/p&gt;
