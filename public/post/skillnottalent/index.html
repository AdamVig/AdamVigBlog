<meta name="description" content="Talent is natural aptitude.
Skill is hard-earned knowledge and experience.
Calling a person talented implies that they were born with the abilities they currently have. Talent is raw, untrained ability.
Calling a person skilled shows respect for the hard work it took to develop their abilities. Skill is honed, well-practiced ability.
It is a much greater compliment to call someone skilled than to call them &ldquo;talented&rdquo;.">
