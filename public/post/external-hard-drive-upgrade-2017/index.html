          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I need an external hard drive for audiovisual production. I use my external hard drive for two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>editing video</li>
<li>recording and editing audio</li>
</ol>

<p>Audio is easy: it does not take much space and does not require high transfer speeds. However, my current drive (a WD My Passport 1TB that I got for free) randomly unmounts, creating huge gaps when recording directly to the drive. The unmounting problem is less apparent when editing video, but is still an annoyance.</p>

<p>Video is trickier: with 4K video becoming the norm, a high speed drive is crucial. My current spinning-disk USB 3.0 drive has been fine, but transfer speeds could certainly be better. The faster the video transfers, the more time I have to work. Also, the faster the drive, the smoother the editing process should be.</p>

<p>The hard drive&rsquo;s connectors are an important consideration. In 2017, I no longer want to buy any peripherals that are not USB-C. This is the new universal connector and it Just Makes Sense. Of course, the connector doesn&rsquo;t tell all: I want a hard drive with the fastest possible transfer speeds, so USB 3.1 and Thunderbolt 3 over USB-C are a must. I will also need a way to plug USB-C into my current laptop, which only has USB-A ports.</p>

<p>The answer to all of my requirements seems to be the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/wd-my-passport-ssd-512gb-external-usb-3-1-gen-2-portable-hard-drive-black-top-gunmetal-medium-metallic-gray-bottom/5786330.p?skuId=5786330">WD My Passport SSD 512GB ($200)</a>. This drive is new, but compares with the existing Samsung Portable SDD T3 500 GB, which costs $180.</p>

<p>In order to get maximal speed and reliability, an external hard drive must have an SSD. Spinning disk drives top out at around 1.5Gbps, which comes nowhere near saturating the possible 40Gbps of Thunderbolt 3 or even the possible 10Gbps of USB 3.1.</p>

<p>The WD My Passport SSD can hit a max speed of 4.12Gbps, meaning that it can almost saturate a USB 3.0 connection (5Gbps). It is almost three times as fast as a traditional spinning disk drive.</p>

<p>The drive uses USB-C with both Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1. It comes with a USB-C to USB-A cable for use with computers lacking USB-C ports.</p>

<p>Another concern is durability. I looked at the LaCie Rugged drives, which are beautiful but extremely expensive. I also looked at the GDrive lineup, the CalDigit Tuff, and a few others, but they were all prohibitively expensive and bulky.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-portable-hard-drive/#what-to-look-forward-to">The Best Portable Hard Drive | The Wirecutter</a> contains a useful tip about &ldquo;rugged&rdquo; external hard drives:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we don’t recommend a rugged portable drive for most people. The three best-rated and most-affordable drives in our research didn’t live up to their water and shock ratings, and the other options are all overkill and far more expensive. If you’re concerned about dropping your drive, you should consider a solid-state drive. SSDs cost more, but they offer faster performance, and your data won’t fall victim to butterfingers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The WD My Passport SSD can survive falls of up to 6.5 feet. Its footprint is smaller than an index card: the long edge is 3.5&rdquo;, the short edge is 1.8&rdquo;, and it is less than half an inch tall.</p>

<p>This drive also has built-in 256-bit AES Hardware Encryption, which is an asset for protecting data in case the drive is ever lost.</p>

<p>My next external hard drive will be the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/wd-my-passport-ssd-512gb-external-usb-3-1-gen-2-portable-hard-drive-black-top-gunmetal-medium-metallic-gray-bottom/5786330.p?skuId=5786330">WD My Passport SSD 512GB ($200)</a>.</p>
