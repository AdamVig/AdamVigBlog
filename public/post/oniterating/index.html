<meta name="description" content="To iterate is to repeat with the intent of reaching a desired goal.
When you know what you want to achieve but you have to create several drafts along the way, you are iterating.
Iterating can be a process of proving yourself.
In situations where money is involved, and the big picture requires a large purchase, the big picture can be attained through a process of several small purchases that prove the validity of the big picture.">

            <p>To iterate is to repeat with the intent of reaching a desired goal.</p>

<p>When you know what you want to achieve but you have to create several drafts
along the way, you are iterating.</p>

<p>Iterating can be a process of proving yourself.</p>

<p>In situations where money is involved, and the big picture requires a large
purchase, the big picture can be attained through a process of several small
purchases that prove the validity of the big picture.</p>

<p>In situations where the goal is a dramatic change in the way something is done,
the change can be achieved through a process of proving that the change will be
better. Apply the process in small pieces.</p>

<p>Iterating can help you see that your ideas are misguided. Instead of going all
in with an unproven idea, the process of iteration forces you to pick your own
idea apart. If it is a good idea, this process has the byproduct of making your
idea succeed. If it is not a good idea, you will see it and change the idea.</p>

<p>To iterate is to prove yourself a little bit at a time.</p>
