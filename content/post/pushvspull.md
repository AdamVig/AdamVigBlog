+++

Consuming information is our new daily activity. It is so easy to do that it
has become a pastime: I read blog posts in waiting rooms, I check Twitter on
the toilet. These are both examples of a “pull.” What I mean is that I, the
user, am voluntarily asking the content provider (a blog, Twitter) for
information. The complement (or opposite, depending on how you look at it) to
this concept of “pull” is (you guessed it) “push.” A push notification is named
as such because the content provider is pushing information to you whether you
like it or not. I make this caveat because in some cases, you may like it: a
text message, a Facebook friend request, or the results of a sports game. But
in other cases, “push” becomes evil: a never-ending group text message, a
Facebook friend asking you to play games with them, or a constant stream of
updates from a sports game. To curb my addiction to information consumption
(specifically from social media with its addiction-fostering tendencies), I
have intentionally limited my “push” activities and turned them into “pull.”
This philosophy has completely changed my phone usage. Not only is my phone now
significantly quieter, but it also has become a way to quickly get up to date on
 any information I missed, then ignore new updates until the next time I am
 ready to “pull.”
