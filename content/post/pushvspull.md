Unlock your phone, open all of your social apps, and turn off push
notifications. Only enable push notifications for apps that need instant
responses, such as messages and email.

When you allow apps to send you push notifications, you give them control over
your schedule. Your attention span is defined by the period in between
interruptions from your phone.

This approach works better than putting your phone on silent because important
notifications will still come through.

Reclaim your attention span. **Pull** information on your own terms instead of
letting apps **push** the information to you.
