Talent is natural aptitude.

Skill is hard-earned knowledge and experience.

Calling a person talented implies that they were born with the 
abilities they currently have. Talent is raw, untrained ability.

Calling a person skilled shows respect for the hard work it took to 
develop their abilities. Skill is honed, well-practiced ability.

It is a much greater compliment to call someone *skilled* than to 
call them "talented".
