**Cross-posting is lazy social media strategy.**

Social media users demand content tailored to the audience. Even though the
audience consists of most of the same people between social networks, those
people expect different types of content on each social network.

*Instagram:*  
- low-frequency posts  
- long-form text content is common in the post description  
- focus on the media, not the network  

*Facebook:*   
- multimedia posts  
- enough text content to explain the media in the post  
- emphasis on engagement in comments  

*Twitter:*  
- high-frequency posts  
- brief text content  
- multimedia posts get the same screen space as text-only posts
