**Never buy a cell phone new at full price.**

Cell carriers are no longer offering subsidies on new phones. $700 is too much
to spend for that new iPhone. The solution: buy used.

Buying used phones gives you the freedom to buy and sell phones whenever you want.

**Your first phone is your upfront investment.**

Put a protective case and screen protector on the phone the moment you take it
out of the box to protect this investment. Protect your investment so you can
sell it for top dollar down the road.

**When you buy a new phone, sell your current phone to recoup some or all of the
cost.**

Check the market price of your current phone before you purchase a new phone to
set a price range for your purchase.

**Where to buy and sell phones:**
All three of these sites have buyer protection, so if your phone is defective
you can send it back for a full refund.

  - Easiest for selling: they ship you a box to put the phone in
  - Highest fees for selling
  - Useful indicator of market price
[Swappa](http://swappa.com)
  - Low selling fees
  - Buyer talks directly to seller, not through Swappa
[Ebay](http://ebay.com)
  - Highest level of risk, but often the best offers
